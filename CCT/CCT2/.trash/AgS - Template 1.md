## Introduction to Scrum

> [!abstract] Scrum (n):
> A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

Scrum is characterized as:
- Lightweight
- Simple to understand
- Difficult to master

> [!info] Scrum is not a process or a technique for building products; 
> rather, it is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques. Scrum makes clear the relative efficacy of your product management and development practices so that you can improve.

The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules. Each component serves a specific purpose and is essential to Scrum's success and usage.

## Scrum Theory

Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.

> [!info] Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control:
> 1) Transparency
> 2) Inspection
> 3) Adaptation

### Transparency

Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome. Transparency requires those aspects be defined by a common standard so observers share a common understanding of what is being seen.

> [!example] Examples of transparency in Scrum:
> - A common language referring to the process must be shared by all participants
> - Those performing the work and those accepting the work product must share a common definition of "Done"

### Inspection

Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances. Their inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way of the work. Inspections are most beneficial when diligently performed by skilled inspectors at the point of work.

### Adaptation

If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being processed must be adjusted. An adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

> [!info] Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation:
> - Sprint Planning
> - Daily Scrum
> - Sprint Review
> - Sprint Retrospective

## The Scrum Team

The Scrum Team consists of:
- Product Owner
- Development Team
- Scrum Master

> [!info] Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional.
> - Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team
> - Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team

The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.

### The Product Owner

The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.

> [!info] The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog:
> - Clearly expressing Product Backlog items
> - Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions
> - Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs
> - Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all
> - Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed

> [!warning] The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. 
> The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a Product Backlog item's priority must address the Product Owner.

### The Development Team

The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.

> [!info] Key characteristics of the Development Team:
> - They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments
> - Development Teams are cross-functional, with all the skills as a team necessary to create a product Increment
> - Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members other than Developer
> - Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team
> - Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills, but accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole

#### Development Team Size

Optimal Development Team size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint.

> [!warning] 
> Smaller Development Teams may encounter skill constraints during a Sprint, while large Development Teams generate too much complexity for an empirical process to manage.

### The Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted. Scrum Masters do this by ensuring that the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices, and rules.

> [!info] The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team. 
> The Scrum Master helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful and which aren't.

#### Scrum Master Service to the Product Owner

- Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management
- Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items
- Understanding product planning in an empirical environment
- Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value
- Understanding and practicing agility
- Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed

#### Scrum Master Service to the Development Team

- Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality
- Helping the Development Team to create high-value products
- Removing impediments to the Development Team's progress
- Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed
- Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments where Scrum is not yet fully adopted

#### Scrum Master Service to the Organization

- Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption
- Planning Scrum implementations within the organization
- Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum
- Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team
- Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of Scrum in the organization

## Scrum Events

Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum. All events are time-boxed events, such that every event has a maximum duration.

> [!info] 
> Other than the Sprint itself, which is a container for all other events, each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt something. These events are specifically designed to enable critical transparency and inspection.

### The Sprint

The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a "Done," useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints best have consistent durations throughout a development effort. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

> [!info] During the Sprint:
> - No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
> - Quality goals do not decrease
> - Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned

#### Cancelling a Sprint

A Sprint can be cancelled before the Sprint time-box is over. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint, although he or she may do so under influence from stakeholders, the Development Team, or the Scrum Master.

> [!example] A Sprint would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. This might occur if:
> - The company changes direction
> - Market or technology conditions change
> - It no longer makes sense given the circumstances

When a Sprint is cancelled, any completed and "Done" Product Backlog items are reviewed. If part of the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it. All incomplete Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog.

### Sprint Planning

The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

> [!question] Sprint Planning addresses two topics:
> 1. What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
> 2. How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

#### Topic One: What can be done this Sprint?

The Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint. The Product Owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint, would achieve the Sprint Goal.

#### Topic Two: How will the chosen work get done?

Having set the Sprint Goal and selected the Product Backlog items for the Sprint, the Development Team decides how it will build this functionality into a "Done" product Increment during the Sprint. The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called the Sprint Backlog.

#### Sprint Goal

The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog. It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment.

### Daily Scrum

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. This is done by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting the work that could be done before the next one.

> [!info] The Daily Scrum addresses three questions:
> 1. What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
> 2. What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
> 3. Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

> [!warning] 
> The Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting, but the Development Team is responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum. The Scrum Master enforces the rule that only Development Team members participate in the Daily Scrum.

### Sprint Review

A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. This is a four-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints (shorter for shorter Sprints).

> [!info] Sprint Review activities include:
> - The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been "Done" and what has not
> - The Development Team discusses what went well, problems encountered, and solutions
> - The Development Team demonstrates the work that has been "Done"
> - The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog and projects likely completion dates
> - The entire group collaborates on what to do next
> - Review of marketplace changes that might affect what's most valuable to do next
> - Review of timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next release

The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint.

### Sprint Retrospective

The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. This is a three-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints (shorter for shorter Sprints).

> [!info] Sprint Retrospective activities include:
> - Inspect how the last Sprint went regarding people, relationships, process, and tools
> - Identify and order major items that went well and potential improvements
> - Create a plan for implementing improvements to how the Scrum Team does its work

By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements that it will implement in the next Sprint.

## Scrum Artifacts

Scrum's artifacts represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation.

### Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product and is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering.

> [!info] The Product Backlog:
> - Evolves as the product and its environment evolve
> - Is dynamic and constantly changes
> - Lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes
> - Has items with attributes of description, order, estimate, and value

> [!warning] The Development Team is responsible for all estimates. 
> The Product Owner may influence the Development Team by helping it understand and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform the work make the final estimate.

#### Monitoring Progress Toward a Goal

At any point in time, the total work remaining to reach a goal can be summed. The Product Owner tracks this total work remaining at least every Sprint Review. This information is made transparent to all stakeholders.

### Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a plan with enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in the Daily Scrum.

> [!warning] Only the Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint. 
> As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is performed or completed, the estimated remaining work is updated.

#### Monitoring Sprint Progress

At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog can be summed. The Development Team tracks this total work remaining at least for every Daily Scrum to project the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal.

### Increment

The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be "Done," which means it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team's definition of "Done."

## Artifact Transparency

Scrum relies on transparency. Decisions to optimize value and control risk are made based on the perceived state of the artifacts.

The Scrum Master must work with the Product Owner, Development Team, and other involved parties to understand if the artifacts are completely transparent. A Scrum Master can detect incomplete transparency by inspecting the artifacts, sensing patterns, listening closely to what is being said, and detecting differences between expected and real results.

> [!tip] 
> The Scrum Master's job is to work with the Scrum Team and the organization to increase the transparency of the artifacts. This work usually involves learning, convincing, and change. Transparency doesn't occur overnight, but is a path.

### Definition of "Done"

When a Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as "Done," everyone must understand what "Done" means.

> [!info] 
> Although this varies significantly per Scrum Team, members must have a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete, to ensure transparency. This is the definition of "Done" for the Scrum Team and is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment.

> [!warning] If "done" for an increment is not a convention of the development organization, 
> the Development Team of the Scrum Team must define a definition of "Done" appropriate for the product. If there are multiple Scrum Teams working on the system or product release, the development teams on all of the Scrum Teams must mutually define the definition of "Done."

Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly tested, ensuring that all Increments work together.

> [!summary] 
> Scrum is a lightweight framework for addressing complex adaptive problems while delivering high-value products. It is founded on empirical process control theory, with three pillars: Transparency, Inspection, and Adaptation. The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, Development Team, and Scrum Master, working together through prescribed events (Sprints, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective) to create valuable Increments. Scrum artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment) provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation. The framework's success depends on a shared understanding of what "Done" means and adherence to Scrum's principles and practices.
